My name is <b>Maria Deslis</b> and I am student majoring in Computer Science.  I love coding, learning, stories, coffee, and making people laugh.

I am intrigued by and enjoy the front-end part of coding, such as user interface and design, the most. I like seeing how it affects people and society - especially when it comes to video games. I firmly believe that video games have the <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/jane_mcgonigal_gaming_can_make_a_better_world" target="_blank">power to change the world for the better</a> and my goal is to one day have my games in the world and be a part of the gaming industry. I have recently started <a href="http://www.pygame.org/news.html" target="_blank">learning PyGame</a> so as to reach that goal.

In my free time I draw/paint/sketch, play with legos, read books, play games (video or otherwise), watch anime, hang out with friends, go to concerts, did I mention I LOVE coffee? I guess, to put it simply, I am very passionate person who just loves to code and wants to make games!
